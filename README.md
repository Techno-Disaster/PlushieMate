# PlushieMate

This is the app in which the model https://github.com/Techno-Disaster/Plushie is used.
The model itself was trained on a really small data set and so the results are not that accurate. But if it sees a similar image or an image from the dataset itself it can identify it properly

### Note: UI right now is a lot better than in the YouTube video. ```flutter run``` to check out the new UI
